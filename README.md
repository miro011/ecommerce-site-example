These are the files to an e-commerenace website created by me using PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS and MySQL. 
Emails and actual processing of orders based on payment has not been added. 
This site used to be hosted when I had a subscribption and owned a domain, but I no longer do.
You can run the site through XAMPP (edit the /php/sql-config.php). To get an admin account, create an account with username admin@admin.com
